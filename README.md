Simple Snake Game in C
This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game using C language. The game runs in the terminal and allows players to control the movement of a snake to eat food and grow longer. However, the game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.

Features:
Terminal-based Interface: The game is played entirely in the terminal, with ASCII characters representing the snake, food, and game board.
Simple Controls: Players can control the snake's direction using the keyboard arrow keys (WASD) to navigate around the game board.
Scoring: The player's score increases as the snake eats food. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls, and the final score is displayed.
